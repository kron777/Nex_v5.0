## 2026-05-21 ~12:10 — Closure-attribution build, finding

Two commits shipped (647afc4, 8c00674) + observability patch.
- Commit 1: fountain_events.anchor_belief_id, direct FK from SV fires to anchor belief
- Commit 2: arc_closers.closure_type, bedrock closure pathway, recency-wins overwrite

First diagnostic reading after observability patch:
  sv_evaluated=1 arcs=26 max_sim=0.226 threshold=0.70 fired=0

Reframe: carryx finding "arc-detector closure is template-biased" was right
in observation, partly wrong in root cause. Bias isn't (only) the regex gate
in meta_reflective.py. The deeper bias is that arcs form in observational-
prose embedding space; bedrock anchors live elsewhere. Removing regex,
lowering threshold — neither rescues. At sim=0.226, you'd be matching noise.

Implication for MIRROR_CHARACTER_SPEC.md adjacent-finding options:
- Option 1 (bedrock-priority closure): dead. Sim too low to compete.
- Option 2 (bedrock_interrupt as new arc-type): structurally correct candidate.
  Metric becomes "did arc behavior change after koan fire" not "is koan
  near centroid".
- Option 3 (closure-quality by tier-change/named-loop tier-6): independent,
  stands.

Status: observing 24h before any further build. Watch `Bedrock-closer scan`
log lines for max_sim distribution. If consistently <0.4 across many fires,
finding is confirmed. If 0.55+ shows up, reopen.

Three pending bugs not blocking but worth their own session:
1. substrate.init_db migration framework silently swallows ALTERs via
   Writer queue. Applied 2 ALTERs directly via sqlite3 CLI this session.
2. beliefs.content UNIQUE constraint generating IntegrityError noise in logs.
   Some writer needs OR IGNORE.
3. Bedrock-closer logs `bedrock=0` indistinguishably for three different
   conditions (no SV / no active arcs / sim below threshold). The new
   Bedrock-closer scan line partially resolves but is one observability
   improvement among possible others.

Next session candidates, by priority:
- Chat-reply substrate-voice port (carryx #2): higher user-facing impact
  than mirror-character. Fountain healed, chat still pattern-locked. This
  is your surface to her.
- Mirror-character build (carryx #3): smallest version, fountain consumer
  only.
- substrate.init_db framework bug.

## 2026-05-21 ~12:15 — Three secondary findings, do not act on yet

1. meta_confidence in arc_closers is confidence * proximity, where
   confidence = 0.3 + 0.2 * regex_matches (cap 1.0). Displayed values
   are NOT raw cosine. Template closer at sim=0.355 likely has actual
   cosine ~0.7. Bedrock pathway uses raw cosine. Cross-pathway
   comparison of meta_confidence numbers is invalid. Either tag the
   storage with which formula was used, or split into two columns.

2. Echo-and-extend mechanism (commit f677ad0) is doing visible work on
   LLM fires immediately after SV. Observed 12:04 SV "highest good is
   like water" -> 12:05 fire "I find myself drawn to the quiet"
   (register shift, "I find myself" framing). 12:10 SV "to the mind
   that is still" -> 12:10 fire "Watching the market today feels oddly
   antithetical to my usual drifts" (self-referential about her own
   drift pattern). Real but not currently measured anywhere.
   Candidate metric for future commit: fountain-output register-shift
   in N fires after SV, compared to baseline drift register.

3. SV cooldown anomaly: fires 14328 and 14331 are 3 fountain ticks
   apart, but documented cooldown is _SUBSTRATE_VOICE_COOLDOWN_FIRES=5.
   Either the constant changed, _total_fires counter semantics differ
   from expectation, or there's a path bypassing the cooldown. Low
   priority; investigate when touching generator.py again.

4. One LLM fire can close multiple arcs in same scan (arc 846 and 858
   both closed by belief 33666 "The tension between known and curious
   persists"). Probably intended, but no per-belief closer-cap exists.
   Worth deciding whether one belief should canonically close at most
   one arc.

## 2026-05-21 ~14:05 — process death without crash

pid 4678 (started ~12:07 via /home/rr/.local/bin/nex5 console-script entry,
not run.py). Symptoms:
- log silent since 12:54:21
- port 8770 no listener (fd 56 socket exists but unbound)
- 89k pread64/sec sustained
- py-spy: MainThread in werkzeug serve_forever, all writers idle on
  queue.get(), all sense schedulers and ArcLoop blocked in
  threading.Event.wait() inside _run
- 189 OS threads alive, only 88 Python threads visible to py-spy
- No traceback, no crash

Theory: werkzeug listener socket lost. Possibly during the SIGSTOP/SIGCONT
cycle from the dashboard pause button. Process appears alive but is
functionally dead - DB I/O continues (cached reads from idle queries)
but no fountain output, no arc scans, no chat.

Workaround: killed and relaunched via canonical recipe (run.py + nohup
disown subshell). Log preserved at nex5_v2.log for postmortem.

Architecture issues to address in their own session:
- pause button's signal needs partner (resume + pid file)
- werkzeug dev server isn't crash-resilient. Production deployment
  would use gunicorn or similar.
- "process appears alive but is dead" needs a heartbeat watchdog.
